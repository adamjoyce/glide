# Meteor Strike
Meteor Strike is a small action game developed in Unity.

The aim is to guard your neon net from the meteors by shooting as many down as possible.  Two blows and the net is destroyed so ready that trigger finger!

This is currently the MVP and further features to make the core gameplay loop more compelling will be added in the future.

## Controls:

Aim - MOUSE X & Y

Fire Projectile - SPACE

PAUSE - P or ESC
